Stuff you need to know with Planning Algorithm


Pre-require math skill:

            Linear Algebra
            Calculas
            Probility


 Path Searching - forward search
           backward search
           bidirectional search

           Dijkstra
           A*(A stand for Admissible Heuristic base on Dijkstra algorithms I guess)
           D*


Convex Space ?

Dynamic Programming  
    --  cost function

Optimization -- Quantic Programming


control: 
         MPC
         Feed-Back Control
         PID
         LQR?




Control: MPC 
         RPM?
